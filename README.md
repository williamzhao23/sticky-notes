## Sticky Notes!

A simple to-do list and note-taking desktop app, meant to mimic the functionality of sticky notes. Users can add tasks, check them off, clear them, or undo cleared tasks. They also have a text area for notes. Saving and loading is done through org.json and Commons IO.

To use the program, just run `Main.java`.
