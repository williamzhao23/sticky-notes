Sticky Notes!

    This simple to-do/notes app has a GUI built with Swing. Users can add
tasks, check them off as done, clear them, and undo any cleared tasks. They
also have a free text area for notes. Users have a slot for saving and loading
through a JSON file. Saving and loading is done through org.json and
Commons IO.
    To use the program, just run Main.java.
    Future goals include saving custom files and adding more visual options.
